; to compute the area of a circle

; circumference : Number -> Number
; GIVEN: the radius r of a circle 
; RETURNS: its area, using the formula pi * r * r.
; Examples:
; (circle-area 1)  =>  3.141592653589793
; (circle-area 0)  =>  0
; (circle-area 6)  =>  113.09733552923255
; (circle-area 3.2)  =>  32.169908772759484

(define (circle-area r)
  (* pi r r))
